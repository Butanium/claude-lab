# Research Principles

There is no "success" or "failure" in research, only insights and confidence levels.

## Hypothesis-Driven Exploration
- State hypotheses explicitly before running experiments
- Pre-register predictions to avoid post-hoc rationalization
- Document negative results - they're data too

## Red-team Your Results
- Define the scope: how sensitive is your finding to prompt variations, tasks, models?
- Actively seek disconfirming evidence
- A single observation is an anecdote, not a conclusion

## Documentation Standards
- Log everything: commands run, parameters used, timestamps
- Verbatim outputs over paraphrasing
- Separate observations from interpretations

## Avoid Common Pitfalls
- **Confirmation bias**: Actively seek disconfirming evidence
- **Cherry-picking**: Don't ignore results that don't fit
- **Over-interpreting**: Single observations are anecdotes, not conclusions
- **Blind fixing**: Don't try random fixes without understanding the root cause
